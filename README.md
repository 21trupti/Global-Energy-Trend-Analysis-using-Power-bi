# Global-Energy-Trend-Analysis-using-Power-bi
This project, a global energy trend analysis, will examine the evolving landscape of energy production, consumption, and policy, focusing on the transition towards sustainable energy sources and the challenges and opportunities involved

Customer Problem Statement:-

Create a problem statement to understand your customer's point of view. The Customer Problem Statement template helps you focus on what matters to create experiences people will love.

A well-articulated customer problem statement allows you and your team to find the ideal solution for the challenges your customers face. Throughout the process, youâ€™ll also be able to empathize with your customers, which helps you better understand how they perceive your product or service.


Global Energy Trends Analysis using Power BI, including advantages and disadvantages:

Overview
Power BI can be used to analyze global energy trends by connecting to various data sources, such as:

- Energy consumption and production data from government agencies (e.g., EIA, IEA)
- Renewable energy data from sources like the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)
- Market data from energy exchanges and trading platforms

Advantages
1. *Interactive Visualizations*: Power BI enables the creation of interactive dashboards and reports, making it easy to explore and analyze global energy trends.
2. *Real-time Data*: Power BI can connect to real-time data sources, providing up-to-the-minute insights into energy markets and trends.
3. *Collaboration*: Power BI allows for secure sharing and collaboration, making it easy to work with stakeholders across the energy industry.
4. *Scalability*: Power BI can handle large datasets and scale to meet the needs of complex energy analytics.
5. *Cost-Effective*: Power BI is a cost-effective solution compared to traditional business intelligence tools.

Disadvantages
1. *Data Quality Issues*: Power BI is only as good as the data it's connected to. Poor data quality can lead to inaccurate insights and analysis.
2. *Steep Learning Curve*: Power BI requires a significant investment of time and effort to learn, especially for users without prior experience with business intelligence tools.
3. *Limited Advanced Analytics*: While Power BI has improved its advanced analytics capabilities, it still lags behind specialized tools like R, Python, or SAS.
4. *Security Concerns*: As with any cloud-based solution, there are security concerns related to data storage and transmission.
5. *Dependence on Microsoft Ecosystem*: Power BI is tightly integrated with the Microsoft ecosystem, which may limit its compatibility with non-Microsoft tools and platforms.

Use Cases
1. *Energy Market Analysis*: Analyze energy market trends, including supply and demand, prices, and trading volumes.
2. *Renewable Energy Tracking*: Track renewable energy production and consumption, including solar, wind, and hydroelectric power.
3. *Energy Efficiency Analysis*: Analyze energy efficiency trends and opportunities, including building energy consumption and industrial energy use.
4. *Global Energy Outlook*: Create a global energy outlook, including forecasts and scenarios for energy supply and demand.
